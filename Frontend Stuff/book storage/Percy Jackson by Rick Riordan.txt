As I stood on the deck of the Argo II, I could see the sprawling city below, lit up like a million fireflies. The sunset painted the sky in shades of orange and pink, and the air was filled with a mix of excitement and tension. I knew this was the moment we had been preparing forâ€”our final confrontation with the forces of evil. Annabeth was by my side, her eyes scanning the horizon with a determined look. "We've got this," she said, trying to reassure me, though I could see the concern in her eyes. "Just stick to the plan." I nodded, trying to steady my nerves. We had faced countless challenges and monsters, but this was different. The fate of the world rested on our shoulders. The realization was both thrilling and terrifying.
